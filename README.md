# ROS-Autonomous-Navigation-using-SLAM
This is a team project where we worked together to develop ROS node(s) to allow the robot to autonomously explore the robot arena containing obstacles. The robot explored as much of the arena as possible in 90 seconds without crashing into anything! Whilst exploring the environment, the robot generated a map of the arena in the background.
